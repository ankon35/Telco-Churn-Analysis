## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns using a dataset of **7,043 customer records**. The analysis helps identify key factors influencing churn, providing insights to improve customer retention strategies. Various techniques in **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** were used to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualize churn-related trends.

2. **Service Usage & Churn**:  
   - Customers with **fiber optic internet** and **multiple lines** have higher churn rates.  
   - **Month-to-month contract holders** make up **85%** of churned customers.  
   - Users paying via **electronic checks** show higher churn compared to automatic payment methods.

3. **Tenure Impact**:  
   - New users (1-2 months of tenure) are most likely to churn.  
   - Long-term customers (55+ months) show a significantly lower churn rate (<15%).

## Recommendations
